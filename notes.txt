Dialogue Notes:
? is for optional.

[header]
AskText?
=ContinueText?
=ContinueText2?
=ContinueTextN?
#AnswerText {Link}?

all of the text can have variables: <variable name> (known one is PlayerName, PersonalMissionCost, PersonalMissionTarget)

AskText is text which the character you're speaking with says to you. It can go onto the next line which makes it annoying to parse
ContinueText starts with an equal sign. Basically, it shows up when you get an option to 'Continue'/'Back'
AnswerText starts with a #. It's what you're givin the option to choose from. It seems to always contain a link.
A Link is a 'link' to another header via name. Dunno if it's cross file, don't think it would be though.
	- {End} seems to be a custom non-listed header to end the current dialogue
I believe some of the dialogue stuff is handled in code, as the empty [EndGame] tag presumably ends the game (I actually haven't gotten to the game end, yet)
Also, the virtual-reality-testing will {End} but still be able to go onto continuing it so it's likely also handled in the code of the game. (Perhaps search the exe?)

Things It opens/Tries accessing. Some of them exist in %appdata%/Heat_Signature
NOTE: Just because it says 'createfile' doesn't mean it was actually trying to create a file. It can read a file with that (at least thats what I think it's doing.) I'm just going off Process Monitor

Launch Options:
You can use
`-output file.txt`
`-debugoutput debugfile.txt`
Will output information to those files. Could be useful.
`-debug` Seems to only show a fps bar in the top left corner.
